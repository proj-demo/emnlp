## Future Work: Incorporating Conceptual Knowledge into Knowledge-attention Encoder  

#### Besides lexical knowledge, we plan to incorporate conceptual knowledge into the proposed knowledge-attention encoder. The conceptual knowledge which is high-level semantics of texts is acquired from encyclopedic knowledge bases such as Probase and Wikipedia. 

#### This can be done by first generating conceptual indicators related to the specific task (not limited to relation extraction) from encyclopedic knowledge bases; and then conceptualising input texts into high-level concepts according to the conceptual knowledge in the knowledge base; eventually transforming text into concept space through knowledge-attention, where the conceptual information of texts related to the specific task can be captured.

#### Such conceptual information will provide more high-level semantics to the model compared with lexical information, and will be useful for various NLP tasks which require semantic understanding.
